TrueType package for µC/GUI
==========================
The µC/GUI implementation of TTF support is based on the FreeType font library
from David Turner, Robert Wilhelm and Werner Lemberg which is available under
www.freetype.org. It is used in µC/GUI under the FreeType license which can be
found under GUI\TrueType\Doc\FTL.txt. It has been slightly adapted and a "glue" 
layer with GUI-functions has been added.


How to use the TrueType package
===============================
1. Unpack the ZIP file.

2. Copy the contents of the folder GUI\TrueType\*.* to your µC-GUI folder.

3. Add all source files of the folder to your project.


Support
=======
Please note that Micrium does not give any support on using the FreeType library.
